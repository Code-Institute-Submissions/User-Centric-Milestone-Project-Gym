# Electric Fitness

This is my gym demo site created to display my use of HTML and CSS to potential employers and clients. It is created with the idea of producing a viable product for a client i.e Electric Fitness owner so that he/she can attract new members to their Gym, retain current members and get across the information needed to get to their client such as opening hours, classes, location and facilities. All done in a responsive format. 
 
 
## UX

My Objective in this design was to create a simple usable website first. Make it easy for potential gym users to see what Electric Fitness is all about. This will help people stay engaged so current users can be easily reminded why they should stay and for potential members why they should join. Simplicity is important so users do not get bored and get to relevant information.

###  User Stories

- Owner
 I want to retain current gym users and attract new users, so that my business can continue to preform and grow. I would like a simple to navigate website with all the relevant details that draws the user in.
 
- Current Member
 I want to know why i should stay, such as membership discount in gym shop and world class facilities and trainers. With such information easy to attain.
 
- Potential Member
 I want to easily navigate the website get the information i want and not get bored.
 I want to see images of what is on offer such as classes, the personal trainers and facilities so i dont waste my time going to gym if   i do not like the look of it.
 I want to know the location of the gym and available ways to contact if i what to give the gym a chance.

In this section i introduce the technologies i have used to build the Gym website.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - markup language for the structure and presentation of World Wide Web contents.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - used to format the layout of Web pages.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Toolkit used to style website with icons.
- [Image Hover](https://www.imagehover.io/) - Toolkit used to create hover effects on images.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - a font and icon toolkit.
    


## Testing

I started testing by going through the user stories.

- First the 'Owner' story. The intended outcome was achieved with a simple, consistant and reasoned navigation menu, a responsive website that sets the information across clearly such as classes facilities and cost. With images in each page to draw the user in.

- Next the 'Current Membership' user story achieved a satisfactory result by presenting membership pricing with what each person gets as a direct result of their membership and reminders of what the gym looks like and the staff who run it.

- The last user story 'Potential Member' accomplished the objectives laid out. Done by creating a simple to navigate website, with images of classes, facilities and staff with the needed information such as location, contact details and prices. The contact forms fields have the required notice set on name and email and once set a notice appears to let the user know no information was sent due to being a demo. The Website was tested on various screen sizes to make sure its was responsive and test on various browsers including Chrome, Firefor, Microsoft Edge.

During the testing of the website i also used the following Tools:

- [Chrome dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
- [css validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
